    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this case study, we will be analyzing the RTLS data set using the k-nearest neighbors to determine locations and to determine potential issues with decisions made regarding the use, and non-use, of the data. We will conduct a more thorough data analysis into these two MAC addresses (00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0 and 00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd) determining locations by using data corresponding to both MAC addresses.  The following questions will be answered:\n",
    "    - Which of these two MAC addresses should be used and which should not be used for RTLS?\n",
    "    - Which MAC address yields the best prediction of location?\n",
    "    - Does using data for both MAC addresses simultaneously yield more, or less, accurate prediction of location?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Furthermore, while k-nearest neighbors has proven to be a good approach to determining location, alternate approaches have been proposed.  One simple alternative approach is to use weights on the received signal strength, where the weight is inversely proportional to the “distance” from the test observation.  This allows for the “nearest” points to have a greater contribution to the k-nearest neighbor location calculation than the points that are “further” away.  We will implement  this alternative prediction method to answer:\n",
    "    - For what range of values of weights are you able to obtain better prediction values than for the unweighted k-nearest neighbor approach?"
